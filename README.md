# Digital `Travel Assistant` ðŸ¤– with LangGraph

This repository contains a modular and compact implementation of an end-to-end multi-agent architecture for a travel assistant chatbot, inspired by the [LangGraph's Travel Assistant project](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/customer-support/customer-support/). 
The original notebook has been transformed into a fully-fledged chatbot application.

      A multi-agent architecture featuring separate specialized agents for different tasks and an orchestrator to manage the workflow.
